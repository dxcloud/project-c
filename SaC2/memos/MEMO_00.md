## Abstract
This **MEMO** is an overview description of all SaC2 **MEMO** documents
located in the same directory.

## Introduction
**MEMOs** are short text documents and are used to describe and explain
the architecture used by **SaC2 Engine**. In order to simplify the reading,
all **MEMOs** adopt a particular structure.    
This document describes the structure of **MEMOs**.

## Memo name
All memos are named in the same way. The name starts with **'MEMO_'**
and followed by a 2-digit number (e.g. 'MEMO_00' for this memo).
The 2-digit number **'XY'** helps to find the section which a memo
belongs to.    
The digit **'X'** refers to a main section, and **'Y'** is
a subsection of **'X'**.

## Memo Structure
The first element of a memo is the title which contains the section number.
A number ends by **'X0'** is an overview type of memos.    
Then, a memo has also several fields such as **'File'**, **'Status'**
or **'Date'** for management purposes.    
The body of the memo comes next.
