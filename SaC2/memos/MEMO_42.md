## Introduction
Each **GameState** has a built-in state machine to handle its lifecycle.
The **StateManager** provides methods that are able to change the current
lifecycle of the **GameState**.

## Lifecycle management methods
The lifecycle management methods provided by **StateManager** return all of them
a status code. The code could be **STATUS_SUCCESS** or **STATUS_CANCEL** (can
be caused whether an unavailable method is called).

### status_t StateManager::initialize_state()
This method must be called once to initialize a state.

**Method to be called:** `GameState::initializing()`

### status_t StateManager::pause_state()
To pause a state. When a state is paused, it is NOT updating any more.

**Method to be called:** `GameState::pausing()`

### status_t StateManager::resume_state()
Resume a state, when called the state can keep updating again.

**Method to be called:** `GameState::resuming()`

### status_t StateManager::stop_state()
Called this method to clean the member attributes of the state.

**Method to be called:** `GameState::cleaning()`

### status_t StateManager::reset_state()
Reinitialize the state.

**Method to be called:** `GameState::initializing()`

## State machine
The following graph show the lifecycle of a **GameState**
